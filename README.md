This is a simple UI tool for viewing full transcripts in a way that you can actually copy them. No software needed and it should work with any Mac with the Podcasts app just by visiting the website, https://alexbeals.com/projects/podcasts/. All you have to do is follow the instructions and drag-and-drop your podcasts folder.

This all works locally without uploading anything, which you can confirm by disabling the Internet after the website is loaded.

Once you drag and drop your files you can browse all of the episodes with transcripts.

Clicking on any of them will pull up the full transcript, which you can copy and paste to whatever tool you want to handle the file in. You can also select multiple transcripts and download them as a single markdown file or as a zip of individual markdown files.

## Where Does This Come From?

The data is locally stored in `~/Library/Group Containers/243LU875E5.groups.com.apple.podcasts/Library/Cache/Assets/TTML`. The tool also pulls in the `.sqlite` folder to display additional information about the podcast to make it easier to find the one you're looking for. Shoutout to @mattdanielmurphy and his [repo here](https://github.com/mattdanielmurphy/apple-podcast-transcript-extractor) which I found when originally trying to do this for a podcast.

## Local Debugging
Loading files doesn't work just by opening from `file://` in your browser, so instead use Python to set up a local server at http://localhost:8000/.

```
python3 -m http.server
```

## Docker Usage

To run this application in a Docker container, you can use the following commands:

```bash
docker build -t apple-podcast-transcripts .
docker run -p 8000:8000 apple-podcast-transcripts
```

Then open your browser to http://localhost:8000.

## How did you get WAL working with sql.js??

Great question. This [issue was the key](https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js/issues/372). But the compiling steps were a nightmare, so I just manually modified the `sql-wasm.js` file. Will need to do this again with a version boost. Specifically you can look for the `dbfile_` bit in code, find the `if(null!=g)` code and copy it with a different variable (and the '-wal' suffix in the filename definition).

Original:
```
function e(g){this.filename="dbfile_"+(4294967295*Math.random()>>>0);if(null!=g){var l=this.filename,n="/",t=l;n&&(n="string"==typeof n?n:ja(n),t=l?x(n+"/"+l):
n);l=ka(!0,!0);t=la(t,(void 0!==l?l:438)&4095|32768,0);if(g){if("string"==typeof g){n=Array(g.length);for(var w=0,A=g.length;w<A;++w)n[w]=g.charCodeAt(w);g=n}ma(t,l|146);n=na(t,577);oa(n,g,0,g.length,0);pa(n);ma(t,l)}}}
```

Replacement:
```
function e(g,zzz){this.filename="dbfile_"+(4294967295*Math.random()>>>0);if(null!=g){var l=this.filename,n="/",t=l;n&&(n="string"==typeof n?n:ja(n),t=l?x(n+"/"+l):
n);l=ka(!0,!0);t=la(t,(void 0!==l?l:438)&4095|32768,0);if(g){if("string"==typeof g){n=Array(g.length);for(var w=0,A=g.length;w<A;++w)n[w]=g.charCodeAt(w);g=n}ma(t,l|146);n=na(t,577);oa(n,g,0,g.length,0);pa(n);ma(t,l)}}if(null!=zzz){var l=this.filename+"-wal",n="/",t=l;n&&(n="string"==typeof n?n:ja(n),t=l?x(n+"/"+l):
n);l=ka(!0,!0);t=la(t,(void 0!==l?l:438)&4095|32768,0);if(zzz){if("string"==typeof zzz){n=Array(zzz.length);for(var w=0,A=zzz.length;w<A;++w)n[w]=zzz.charCodeAt(w);zzz=n}ma(t,l|146);n=na(t,577);oa(n,zzz,0,zzz.length,0);pa(n);ma(t,l)}}}
```
